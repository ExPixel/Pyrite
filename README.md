[![Build Status](https://github.com/ExPixel/Pyrite/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ExPixel/Pyrite/actions?query=workflow%3ATests)

GBA emulator. Unlike in the original pyrite actually rendering to the screen and playing audio is abstracted away from the GBA itself
so it can be run in a headless mode.

To use the emulator:

```sh
cargo run -- <ROM>
```
